# Forecasting-Startup-Futures-Leveraging-Data-Science-for-Risk-and-Success-Analysis

##  Abstract
Startups face high failure rates due to factors like market misalignment, funding issues, and operational inefficiencies. This project presents a data-driven framework using Machine Learning (CatBoost, XGBoost) and Deep Learning (Neural Networks) to predict startup success and assess associated risks. It incorporates Explainable AI (SHAP) to provide transparency, using multi-source data from Crunchbase and SEMrush to offer actionable insights for entrepreneurs, investors, and policymakers.

## 📊 Datasets

### 1. **Crunchbase Dataset**
- Features: Funding rounds, team size, industry, acquisitions
- Purpose: Analyze startup financial health & organizational strength

### 2. **SEMrush Dataset**
- Features: Web traffic, SEO ranking, domain authority
- Purpose: Evaluate digital presence & market reach

These datasets are integrated to create a comprehensive view of startup health and future prospects.

## 🛠️ Methodology

### Models Used:
- **CatBoost**: Great for handling categorical variables (e.g. industry, stage)
- **XGBoost**: Efficient on imbalanced and large-scale structured data
- **Neural Networks**: Handle complex non-linear patterns and time-series trends

### Training & Validation:
- 70% Training | 15% Validation | 15% Test
- Optimized with Grid Search, Dropout, Batch Normalization, and Adam Optimizer
